1.	 	While doing BFS make vis[node] = 1 and then insert into the queue.
 		Dont pop out and then make it visited. Because at one instant only one copy of the node should be  in the queue.

2.		memset(dis,0x7f,sizeof(dis)); //For setting large values using memset. 
									//Sets to 2139062143 in case of int
									//sets to 9187201950435737471 in case of long long int

3. 		The Chicken McNugget Theorem (or Postage Stamp Problem or Frobenius Coin Problem) 			states that for any two relatively prime positive integers m,n, the greatest integer 		 that cannot be written in the form am + bn for nonnegative integers a, b is 					mn-m-n.
