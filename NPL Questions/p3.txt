Pratyush finally made "The Proposal" to the girl he likes.
But the girl is still not sure of Pratyush's programming capabilities.
So she asks him to solve a simple programming question.

First she gives him a range $[l,r]$.

Then she gives him $Q$ queries. 
Each query consists of an integer $n$.
She asks him to print the first integer $p$ which satisfies three conditions: 
-			$(p-1)!$ mod $p$ = $(p-1)$  where $[(p-1)! = 1*2*3.......*(p-1)]$
-			$p \geq n$
-			$l \leq p \leq r$.

If no such $p$ exists in the range she asks him to print $-1$.

As Pratyush doesn't want to hear a NO, he asks for your help.


###Input:
 First line contains $T$, the number of test cases.
 Each test case contains the following lines.
 The first line contains three integers $l,r,Q.$
 It is followed by $Q$ lines.
 Each line contains an integer $n$.


###Output:
 For each query print the integer $p$.

###Constraints:
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
- $3 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9$
- $ r-l \leq 10^5$
- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^9$

###Sample Input:
	1
	3 10 3
	6
	7
	8

###Sample Output:
	7
	7
	-1
