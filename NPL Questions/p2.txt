Finally the girl whom Pratyush asked out agreed to go out with him.
So they decided to go on a date to a romantic restaurant.

There are $n$ restaurants in Warangal with their coordinates on the map as $(Xi,Yi)$ for $1 \leq i \leq n.$

A restaurant is romantic only if it is not dominated by any other restaurant in Warangal.

A restaurant $i$ is dominated by a restaurant $j$ if and only if $Xj > Xi$ and $Yj > Yi.$

So Pratyush asks you to find out how many restaurants can they go on a date.


### Input:
The first line contains number of test cases $T$.
Each test case consists of an integer $n$.
Next n lines contains $Xi$,$Yi$ - the coordinates of $i$th restaurant.

### Output:
For each test case output on a single line the number of restaurants available for them to eat.

### Constraints:
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq n \leq 10^5$
- $-10^9 \leq Xi,Yi \leq 10^9$

### Sample Input:
	2
	4
	1 1
	2 2
	3 3
	4 4
	3
	1 5
	2 1
	3 2

### Sample Output:
	1
	2

### Explanation: 

##### Sample case 1: 
	(1,1) is dominated by the other three restaurants. 
	(2,2) is dominated by (3,3) and (4,4).
	(3,3) is dominated by (4,4).
	only (4,4) is not dominated by any other restaurant.


##### Sample case 2:
	(3,2) dominates (2,1) but it doesnt dominate (1,5).
	So we have 2 restaurants (1,5) and (3,2) which are not dominated by any other restaurant.

Do for:
3
1 5
2 1
2 2

3.
