Avinash, Somesh, Kanakdeep and Shibam have started playing PUBG as a team.
As all of them are noobs, they don't exactly know how to land perfectly.

They planned to go to Pochinki this time.

The four of them managed to land at random houses in Pochinki.
Pochinki has a lot of houses represented as a matrix of size n*n. Each house is a four walled (1x1) cell.
Two houses are adjacent if they share a wall.

But only a few of the houses( V of them to be exact) contain KAR.98k : a special gun which all four of them want.

It takes only one second to go from one house to another. 

All four of them want KAR.98k as soon as possible.

What is the minimum time required for each player to get the KAR.98k?

Input:
The first line contains T - the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of the following lines:
The first line contains n - the size of matrix.
It is followed by n*n integers represented value of each cell.
If the value is 1 means it contains KAR.98k and 0 if it doesn't.

The next line contains Q. The number of times they have played the game.(Number of queries -_-)

Each query consists of 4 lines:
i1 j1 - cell where Avinash landed.
i2 j2 - cell where Somesh landed.
i3 j3 - cell where Kanakdeep landed.
i4 j4 - cell where Shibam landed.

Output:
For each query print four integers t1,t2,t3,t4
the minimum time taken for each of them to get an AWP.


Sample input:
1
4
1 0 0 1
0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
1
1 2
1 4
3 1
4 2

Sample output:

Constraints:
1<=T<=10
1<=n<=500
1<=v<=n*n
1<=Q<=100000
1<=i1,j1,i2,j2,i3,j3,i4,j4<=n
