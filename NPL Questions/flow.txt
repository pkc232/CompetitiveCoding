The ACM team needs to prepare $K$ problems for NPL over $N$ days.
Each problem, once prepared, also has to be printed.
The preparation of a problem on day $i$ (at most one per day) costs <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> rupees, and the printing of a problem on day $i$ (also at most one per day) costs <b>B<sub>i</sub></b> rupees. Of course, a problem cannot be printed before it has been prepared (but doing both on the same day is fine).
What is the minimum cost of preparation and printing?
</p>

<p>
<b>Input:</b>
The first line contains $T$ - the number of test cases.<br>
Each test case has three lines of input.<br>
The first line of input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.<br>
The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers A<sub>1</sub>, ..., A<sub>n</sub> — the preparation costs. <br> 
The third line contains $N$ space-separated integers B<sub>1</sub>, ..., B<sub>n</sub>  — the printing costs. <br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Output:</b>
For each test case output the minimum cost of preparation and printing $K$ problems on a new line.
</p>

<p>
<b>Constraints</b>:<br>
1 <= K <= N <= 2200 <br>
1 <= A<sub>i</sub> <= 10^9 <br>
1 <= B<sub>i</sub> <= 10^9 <br>

Sample Input:<br>
	1<br>
	8 4<br>
	3 8 7 9 9 4 6 8<br>
	2 5 9 4 3 8 9 1<br>
</p>

<p>
Sample Output:<br>
	32
</p>

<p>
Explanation:<br>
In the sample testcase, one optimum solution is to prepare the first problem on day 1 and print it on day 1, prepare the second problem on day 2 and print it on day 4, prepare the third problem on day 3 and print it on day 5, and prepare the fourth problem on day 6 and print it on day 8.
