STRING HASHING

http://codeforces.com/contest/727/problem/E


We have to just find the break point in this question. Once we find the breakpoint we just have to print all the continuous substrings of length k.

There can be at max n break points.
This problem I solved using hashing.

For all the g strings provided first calculate their hashvalue and store in an unordered_set "present".
Append the copy of the string to itself. Let it be totstring.
Next use rolling hash on the totstring considering each substring of length k,compute its hash
(using rollhash). Then if this hash is present in the unordered_set "present" increase the count of
that breakpoint by 1. Means count[i%k]++.

Now iterate through all the breakpoints and if their count is n,means its a possible solution.
